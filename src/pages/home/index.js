        <p>
          The aim of building a predictive model for house prices is to develop
          a tool that can accurately estimate the sale prices of houses in the
          King County area, including Seattle, based on various features or
          attributes associated with the houses. This predictive model can
          assist real estate professionals, buyers, sellers, and investors in
          making informed decisions about pricing, purchasing, and selling
          houses in the region.

          with the aim of predicting home sales, in this link; and the data size
          is 2.52 MB. The dataset at hand encompasses comprehensive information
          on house sales within King County, an area that includes the vibrant
          urban center of Seattle. It comprises a total of 21 columns, offering
          insights into various aspects of the housing market.

          This dataset presents a valuable resource for exploring and assessing
          the dynamics of the real estate market in King County. It allows for a
          comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing house prices,
          including property characteristics, location, and various other
          relevant features. With its detailed information on individual
          property sales, the dataset facilitates the construction and
          evaluation of predictive models for house prices. Moreover, the
          inclusion of geographical coordinates provides an opportunity for
          spatial analysis, enabling researchers to explore any potential
          spatial trends or patterns in housing prices within the region.
          Furthermore, the dataset's temporal dimension, with the inclusion of
          the sale dates, offers the potential to investigate any temporal
          trends or seasonality effects that might influence the housing market
          in King County.
